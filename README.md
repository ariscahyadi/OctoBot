# OCTOBOT (Orchestration for Traffic Generator Bot)

## What is OCTOBOT?

OCTOBOT is a unique open source orchestration system or tool to
be used to emulate a human for generating random and various traffic (e.g., web
browsing, email, file transfer, and so on) which is modular or flexible implementation,
scalable for tremendous number client/service, and simple/lightweight execution through
CLI (command-line interface) or API (application programming interface).
